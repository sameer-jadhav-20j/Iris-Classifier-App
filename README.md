# Iris Flower Classifier Web App

This is a professional Streamlit-based machine learning web application that predicts the species of an iris flower using a Random Forest Classifier. The app allows users to input flower measurements interactively and receive real-time predictions.

##  Features

- Interactive UI using Streamlit
- Slider-based inputs for sepal and petal dimensions
- Real-time prediction of iris species
- Preview of dataset samples
- Visualization of feature relationships using pairplot

##  Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Dataset**: Iris dataset from scikit-learn
- **Training**: `model_train.py` trains and saves the model as `iris_model.pkl`
- **Deployment**: `app.py` provides a frontend for interaction and prediction
